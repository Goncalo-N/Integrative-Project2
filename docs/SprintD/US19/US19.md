# US 019 - Send to the NHS daily reports of Covid-19 data, including the number of observed values and estimated values.


## 1. Requirements Engineering

### 1.1. User Story Description

The Many Labs company wants to send to the NHS daily reports of Covid-19 data, including the number of observed values and estimated values. Reports should be generated automatically with historical data and must be sent every day at 6:00 am.


### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

**From the Specifications Document:**

> "The report should include day and week (observed and estimated) values..." and also "Reports...must be sent every day at 6:00 am"

**From the client clarifications:**

> **Question:**As the report is generated automatically, should the system generate a notication that the report was sent?
>  
> **Answer:**The application should write the event into a log file.

-

> **Question:** in Sprint D Requirements, it says "The report should include day and week (observed and estimated) values..." and also "Reports...must be sent every day at 6:00 am". As the Report is to be automatically sent very early in the morning, do you wish the report to have the data concerning the day before and the last week starting at the day before?
>  
> **Answer:** The format of the report should follow the report example that is available in moodle.

-

> **Question:** Should the report contain the data of all the tests with results (with or without report, with or without validation) or contain only the validated tests? (Or other option?)
>   
> **Answer:**  The NHS Covid report should include statistics computed only from validated tests.

-

> **Question:**Are we going to be able to use more math libraries in order to facilitate the calculus (for example, for confidence intervals) or is the rest of the calculus to be developed by each team?
>  
> **Answer:** Each team should implement the classes and methods needed.

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1:** The report should include day and week (observed and estimated) values, the regression model used to estimate each value, R(SLR), R2 
and R2 adjusted for SLR and MLR, hypothesis tests for regression coefficients significance model with Anova.
Simple linear and multilinear regression models can be used to compute the estimates and corresponding confidence intervals.
When the system is configured to use the simple linear regression model, the
performance of each model should be used to select the best model (the one that
uses the number of tests realized or the one that uses the mean age as independent
variable). The best model will be used to make the estimated/expected values that
will be send to NHS. The interval of dates to fit the regression model and the
number of historical points (number of days and number of weeks) must be
defined through a configuration file. The system should send the report using the
NHS API (available in moodle).

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |	... interacting with the actor? | CreateRepUI   |  Pure Fabrication: there is no reason to assign this responsibility to any existing class in the Domain Model.           |
| 			  		 |	... coordinating the US? | CreateRepController | Controller                             |
| 			  		 |	... instantiating a new Report? | Administrator   | Creator: R1   |
| Step 2  		 |							 |             |                              |
| Step 3  		 |	...saving the inputted data? | System  | IE: object created in step 1 is saved by the System .  |
| Step 4  		 |	...knowing the test types to show? | Administrator  | IE: Reports are defined by the Administrator. |
| Step 5  		 |	... saving the selected report? | Administrator | IE: object created in step 1 is classified in one or more Type of Test.  |
| Step 6  		 |							 |             |                              |              
| Step 7  		 |	... validating all data (local validation)? | Rep | IE: owns its data.| 
| 			  		 |	... validating all data (global validation)? | Company | IE: knows all its reports.| 
| 			  		 |	... "send" the created report? | Company | IE: owns all its reports.| 
| Step 8  		 |	... informing operation success?| CreateRepUI  | IE: is responsible for user interactions.  | 

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are: 

 * Company
 * Administrator
 * Rep


Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified: 

 * CreateRepUI  
 * CreateRepController
